# OS_Project
The Project is about to find the Maximum Acceptable Page Fault Rate for Access Time.
it takes 8 milisecond to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replace paged is not modified,
and it takes 20 milisecond if the replaced page is modified,
the memory access time is 100 nanosecond,
and also given that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time,
so wee have to generate a solution to find maximum acceptable page fault rate for access time that is not more than 200 nanosecond.
